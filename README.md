    <sup><strong>Requires the latest version of <a href="https://github.com/CBATeam/CBA_A3/releases">CBA A3</a>.<br/>Requires the latest version of  <a href="http://cup-arma3.org/">Community Upgrade Project</a> (Weapons, Units and Vehicles).</strong></sup>
</p>

**CFP** is a community project to provide Arma 3 with 100 new or enhanced real world factions/sub-factions involved in current and historical armed conflicts. CFP comes in two flavours - CFP and CFP Ultimate, only CFP requires **Community Upgrade Project (CUP)**. 

CFP offers not only enhanced vanilla CUP factions but also a huge number of new factions using CUP and community donated assets. CFP includes custom assets and textures in order to help expand whats possible with CUP. 

CFP Ultimate will enhance base CFP factions (if running CFP) and introduces new factions using the most efficient combination of community gear, weapon and vehicle addons. CFP Ultimate dependencies are TBD.

Factions are delivered in a modular way, enabling groups to maintain their own tailored version of CFP by simply excluding any components they don't need, or those possibly in conflict with other mods. 

## CFP Features
* CFP plus CFP Ultimate provides 91 new factions! (excluding enhanced CUP factions)
* CFP introduces 59 new factions based on CUP + custom assets (including 9 new civilian factions)

## Customizing loadouts for CFP units in 3DEN
CFP uses technology to script and randomize loadouts of units - this provides a massive variety for the units you'll see on the battlefield. In order to customize the loadouts of units in 3DEN editor, you will first need to disable the scripted loadout and/or the randomization. To do this simply:

1. Right-Click the unit in 3D Editor (3DEN)
2. Select Attributes
3. Check the box Override ALiVE ORBAT Loadout and/or Disable CFP Randomization as needed.

## Assets Needed for CFP

Where available we have used the correct assets for each faction. Where an asset is unavailable we have used a placeholder. For a list of the assets we are looking to be donated to the project see [here](https://github.com/tupolov/cfp/issues/48).
